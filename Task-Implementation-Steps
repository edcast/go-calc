Build a docker image for the application and publish it

<Naveen> - Docker image has been created for the application from the Dockerfile in the repo.
Deploy the application in a kubernetes cluster - minikube will be fine. Deployment technique should be extendible to multiple environments.

<Naveen> - A pipeline for automated deployment of the application has been created with the help of AWS Developer tools: 
AWS-CodePipeline/AWS-CodeBUild/AWS-CodeDeploy

During the build process the image is pushed to docker hub registry from which the application is deployed as a pod to the Kubernetes
(1 master/1 worker) node cluster hosted on Ec2.

Bonus: Build the missing functionality

<Naveen>: The logic for division operation has been added in the main.go script file. 
Anything extra is always welcome
